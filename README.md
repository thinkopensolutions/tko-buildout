# BUILDOUT Odoo Installation
Follow this steps to build an Odoo installation from scratch:
 * Clone this repository into a new directory, for example:
```
$~> mkdir odoo100
$~> cd odoo100
$odoo100> git clone git@github.com:thinkopensolutions/tko-buildout.git
```
 * Run bash script from the repository (to install all dependencies):
```
$odoo100> ./tko-buildout/setup.sh
```
 * Answer the following script questions (example for localhost):
 Â * Select base buildout file to extend from list [it must be relative path of the file] (/home/username/odoo100/tko-buildout/odoo100.cfg);
  * Insert database host (localhost);
  * Insert database port (5432);

# DAY TO DAY USAGE
 * Buildout with:
```
$odoo100> bin/buildout
```

```
$odoo100> bin/start_odoo
```

```
$odoo100> bin/start_odoo -d DATABASE -u MODULE --stop-after-init
```
