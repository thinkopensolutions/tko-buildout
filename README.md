$~> sudo apt-get update
$~> sudo apt-get install postgresql-9.5 postgresql-client-9.5

# BUILDOUT Odoo Installation
Follow this steps to build an Odoo installation from scratch:
 * Clone this repository into a new directory, for example:
```
$~> mkdir odoo80
$~> cd odoo80
$odoo80> git clone git@github.com:thinkopensolutions/tko-buildout.git
```
 * Run bash script from the repository (to install all dependencies):
```
$odoo80> ./tko-buildout/setup.sh
```
 * Answer the following script questions (example for localhost):
 Â * Select base buildout file to extend from list [it must be relative path of the file] (/home/username/odoo80/tko-buildout/odoo80.cfg);
  * Insert database host (localhost);
  * Insert database port (5432);
  * Insert database user (odoo80);
  * Insert database password (odoo80);
  * Insert Odoo admin password (admin)

# DAY TO DAY USAGE
 * Buildout with:
```
$odoo80> bin/buildout
```
 * This is the day-to-day operation, rerun to apply any changes you do to buildout.cfg, and update repositories, and start Odoo with:
```
$odoo80> bin/start_odoo
```
 * You can place Odoo paramenters here like -d -u and others, example:
```
$odoo80> bin/start_odoo -d DATABASE -u MODULE --stop-after-init
```
